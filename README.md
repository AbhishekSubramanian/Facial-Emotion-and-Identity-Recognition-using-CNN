# Facial Emotion and Identity Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks

This project develops a model for real-time facial recognition and emotion detection using a computer's webcam. It employs Tensorflow and Keras for crafting a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), alongside OpenCV for webcam frame extraction and various Computer Vision operations.
